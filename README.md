Legal Document Summarizer
Overview
This project implements a legal document summarizer using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in Python. The aim is to extract and summarize key legal information from complex legal documents, making them more accessible and understandable.

Code Explanation
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
The legal documents are loaded and preprocessed:

Text is cleaned and tokenized.
Stopwords and irrelevant characters are removed.
2. Text Processing and Analysis
Advanced NLP techniques are applied to process and understand legal language:

Named Entity Recognition (NER) identifies key entities such as parties, dates, and legal clauses.
Sentiment analysis evaluates the tone and sentiment of the text.
Topic modeling extracts major themes and topics from the documents.
3. Summarization
The summarized legal information is generated using various techniques:

Extractive Summarization: Key sentences or paragraphs are extracted verbatim from the documents.
Abstractive Summarization: Summaries are generated by paraphrasing and rephrasing the content using advanced language models.
4. Output Generation
The summarized legal information is presented in a structured format:

Summaries are formatted for easy reading and reference.
Relevant legal clauses, entities, and dates are highlighted for clarity.
Usage
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Elangovan0101/legal-document-summarizer.git
Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Python script:

python legal_summarizer.py

Results
The legal document summarizer generates concise summaries that capture the essential information from complex legal documents. Users can quickly understand the key clauses, entities, and dates without having to read through lengthy texts.

# Legal Document Summarizer: Extracting Legal Insights with NLP ðŸ“œðŸ’¡

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Legal Document Summarizer project! ðŸŒŸ This project leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract key insights from complex legal documents, making legal analysis more efficient and accessible.

## What's Inside:

### 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing:
- Clean and preprocess legal documents to prepare them for analysis.
- Normalize text and remove irrelevant characters and stopwords.

### 2. Text Processing and Analysis:
- Utilize Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify key entities such as parties, dates, and legal clauses.
- Perform sentiment analysis to gauge the tone and sentiment of the legal text.
- Apply topic modeling techniques to extract major themes and topics from the documents.

### 3. Summarization Techniques:
- Implement both extractive and abstractive summarization methods to generate concise summaries of legal documents.
- Extract key sentences or paragraphs verbatim for extractive summarization.
- Generate summaries by paraphrasing and rephrasing the content for abstractive summarization.

## Get Started:
